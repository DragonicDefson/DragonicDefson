- 👋 Hi, I’m Bradley Methorst, Welcome to my GitHub page!
- 👨‍💻 I post projects occasionally on my GitHub, not in a full schedule due to other bigger projects that are on my mind!
- 👀 I’m interested in .. Literally every aspect of technology, one day not behind my computer, is not a day in my life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .NET MAUI, and I'm planning to get into Blazer!
- 📪 How to reach me? Honestly, I'm really a loner, so.. not programming related? Just don't.
- 📬 Hire me? [E-mail me](mailto:contact@bradleymethorst.com?subject=GitHub%20-%20Hiring%20request)
- 🧑‍💻 GitLab backup instance: <https://gitlab.bradleymethorst.com/DragonicDefson>
