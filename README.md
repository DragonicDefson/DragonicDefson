- 👋 Hi, I’m Bradley Methorst, Welcome to my GitHub page!
- 👨‍💻 I post projects occasionally on my GitHub, not in a full schedule due to other bigger projects that are on my mind!
- 👀 I’m interested in .. Literally every aspect of technology, one day not behind my computer, is not a day in my life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .NET MAUI, and I'm planning to get into Blazer!
- 📫 How to reach me, I'm really a loner, so yeah.. just don't..
